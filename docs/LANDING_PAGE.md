## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 3D Scene Components

```jsx
// Blockchain Network with animated blocks
<BlockchainNetwork />

// Floating DApp icons with physics
<DAppIcon3D position={[x, y, z]} color="#00f5ff" />

// Particle system for visual effects
<CryptoParticles count={100} />
```

### Performance Monitoring

```jsx
// Real-time FPS monitoring
const [performance, setPerformance] = useState({ fps: 60 });

// Overlap detection for design optimization
const checkOverlaps = () => {
  /* ... */
};
```

### Responsive Breakpoints
